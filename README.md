# Optimal_Generation_Photonic_Graphs_Public
This package is a graph state simulator for preparing photonic graph states
from quantum emitters, with minimal resources. It contains optimizers for 
reducing the emitter-emitter CNOT gate count during the generation of 
photonic graph states from quantum emitters. The generation is simulated 
via the stabilizer tableau. This library includes extra functionalities such
as: 
* Bullet list
recognizing circle graphs,recognizing local complement (LC) equivalence of 
graphs, enumerating LC orbits of circle graphs, and generating the LC orbit
of a graph.

This code is used 
to produce the results in the paper "Optimization complexity and resource 
minimization of emitter-based photonic graph state generation protocols", 
by E. Takou, E. Barnes, and S. E. Economou.
